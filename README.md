# SARS-CoV-2-Sequence-Analysis-Pipeline

ANALYSIS PIPELINE:

**Step 1:** Mapping the SNP's (mutations)

**Step 2:** Parsing the files to obtain the coding sequences for each gene and strain in the whole genome

**Step 3 :** Multiple Sequence Alignment: Using BLAST+ 

   Compare the coding sequences from all the various strains of ORF1ab to the mutated reference genome file.
  
**Step 4:** Parse and interpret output files
